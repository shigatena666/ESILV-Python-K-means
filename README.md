# Python-K-means

## Presentation

This (small) project was made during my first academic year in engineering classes.
The goal was to make a simple implementation of the K-means algorithm, allowing to choose for an input file and variables to output in matplotlib.
The algorithm needed to support different dimensions (actually tested up to 5, either floats or integers) as well as different ways to compute the distances (euclidean, manhattan, minkowski).


## Usage

Simply execute main.py and enter the prompted informations.
